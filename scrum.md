**SCRUM Fundamentals**

1. Most popular agile framework for software development.
2. Process framework used to manage product development and other knowledge framework.

**4 Components of scrum Framework.**

1. SCRUM team
2. SCRUM events
3. Scrum Artifacts
4. Scrum rules

**3 Pillars of SCRUM**

1. Transparency - All reqd info is available, and understanding is clear (Dev team should have clarity)
2. Inspection - Regular monitoring for early detection of issues. (Rectify as early as possible)
3. Adaptation - Course correction to prevent further deviation

**Scrum team**

1. Product Owner
2. Development team
3. Scrum Master

**Product Owner**

**Responsibilities**

1. Maximize the total value of work done by dev team
2. Product Backlog Management (List of all the pending tasks)
3. Maintain a transparent list of actions and backlogs
4. Clearly express the requirements and order the requirements based on priority.

**Authorities**

1. Is Always a single person.
2. All changes to the product backlog must come through the Product owner and not from anyone else.

**Development team**

**Responsibilities** :

1. Work on the requirements and deliver a potentially releasable product end of each sprint.

**Authority** :

1. How the work should be done is left to the development team.

**Characteristics of SCRUM dev team**

1. Cross Functional (No external dependency)
2. It is Self-Organizing

Scrum has a strict rule, that there is no No titles and sub-teams within the development team.

Ideal Team Size : No right answer. Based on requirements, org etc. (But 3 to 9).

**SCRUM Master**

**Responsibilities**

1. Ensure effective implementation of the concepts.
2. All scrum related things such as maintaining the product backlog, helping the dev team create high value products etc.
3. Facilitating SCRUM events.
4. Ensure SCRUM Artifacts are properly maintained.
5. Single point of contact to understand SCRUM.

**SCRUM events**

5 main events

1. sprint
2. Sprint planning
3. Daily Scrum
4. Sprint Review
5. Sprint Retrospective.

**Features of SCRUM events.**

1. Should be regular (Can be of any frequency (weekly, monthly or daily))
2. Are Time Boxed (Limit on the duration of the events) E.g (Daily meeting should be of 15 mins only)
3. If any discrepancies, SCRUM master has to be notified and they take necessary steps to ensure its resolved.

**Events are based on the 3 pillars of SCRUM (Transparency, Inspection and Adaptability)**

1. **Sprint**

Period of X days (usually less than 30). If more than 30 days the requirement might change which can potentially affect the development goal.

1. **Sprint planning**

Meeting in which plan for the sprint is fixed.

Happens only once in Each Sprint.

Entire SCRUM team (Product Owner, SCRUM master and development team must be part of the event)

Time Box for the event should not be more than 8 hours.

**Two agendas.**

1. What is to be done in this sprint

2. Establish how it&#39;ll be done.

**What is to be done?**

1. As we know Product Owner keeps the list of backlogs, he sits with the SCRUM team and explains all the items that can be completed in this SPRINT.

1. Dev team will asses based on the Empirical data points. (How much work they were able to do in last SPRINT) - Team Velocity

_Estimation Poker - SCRUM master will arrange activities like Estimation Poker._

**How it will be done.**

1. Dev team will be able to tell the plan.
2. Not a fixed plan and evolves as more clarity increases.

**SCRUM Master work in Sprint planning.**

1. He facilitates this event.
2. Ensures everyone understands the agenda and rules for this event.
3. Is responsible for the success of all these events.

**Daily Scrum**

1. Daily 15 minutes event mainly for the dev team and SCRUM master, optional Product Owner. (Same Place and Same Time)
2. Daily SCRUM is implementation of 2 pillars (Regular inspection and Early adaptation)

**What is done**

1. Every person tells the team what he has done yesterday and what he will do today.
2. He also calls out blockers which may stop from attaining the SPRINT goal

**SPRINT review**

Review of the product increment created in the SPRINT.

Attendees : Entire SPRINT team and other Stakeholders.

Note : It&#39;s not a review or handover meeting.

Basically to increase the transparency between stakeholders and SCRUM team.

**Time Box is less than 4 Hours**

**What Happens?**

1. **Product Owner invites all attendees.**
2. Also highlights completed and non-completed items.
3. Dev team shares sprint experience, highlight challenges.
  1. Dev team demos the completed items.
  2. Stake holders ask questions on the Demo.
4. Product Owner opens the backlog and initiate discussion on what to do next.
