**SCRUM Fundamentals**

1. Most popular agile framework for software development.
2. Process framework used to manage product development and other knowledge framework.

**4 Components of scrum Framework.**

1. SCRUM team
2. SCRUM events
3. Scrum Artifacts
4. Scrum rules

**3 Pillars of SCRUM**

1. Transparency - All reqd info is available, and understanding is clear (Dev team should have clarity)
2. Inspection - Regular monitoring for early detection of issues. (Rectify as early as possible)
3. Adaptation - Course correction to prevent further deviation

**Scrum team**

1. Product Owner
2. Development team
3. Scrum Master

**Product Owner**

**Responsibilities**

1. Maximize the total value of work done by dev team
2. Product Backlog Management (List of all the pending tasks)
3. Maintain a transparent list of actions and backlogs
4. Clearly express the requirements and order the requirements based on priority.

**Authorities**

1. Is Always a single person.
2. All changes to the product backlog must come through the Product owner and not from anyone else.

**Development team**

**Responsibilities** :

1. Work on the requirements and deliver a potentially releasable product end of each sprint.

**Authority** :

1. How the work should be done is left to the development team.

**Characteristics of SCRUM dev team**

1. Cross Functional (No external dependency)
2. It is Self-Organizing

Scrum has a strict rule, that there is no No titles and sub-teams within the development team.

Ideal Team Size : No right answer. Based on requirements, org etc. (But 3 to 9).

**SCRUM Master**

**Responsibilities**

1. Ensure effective implementation of the concepts.
2. All scrum related things such as maintaining the product backlog, helping the dev team create high value products etc.
3. Facilitating SCRUM events.
4. Ensure SCRUM Artifacts are properly maintained.
5. Single point of contact to understand SCRUM.

**SCRUM events**

5 main events

1. sprint
2. Sprint planning
3. Daily Scrum
4. Sprint Review
5. Sprint Retrospective.

**Features of SCRUM events.**

1. Should be regular (Can be of any frequency (weekly, monthly or daily))
2. Are Time Boxed (Limit on the duration of the events) E.g (Daily meeting should be of 15 mins only)
3. If any discrepancies, SCRUM master has to be notified and they take necessary steps to ensure its resolved.

**Events are based on the 3 pillars of SCRUM (Transparency, Inspection and Adaptability)**

1. **Sprint**

Period of X days (usually less than 30). If more than 30 days the requirement might change which can potentially affect the development goal.

1. **Sprint planning**

Meeting in which plan for the sprint is fixed.

Happens only once in Each Sprint.

Entire SCRUM team (Product Owner, SCRUM master and development team must be part of the event)

Time Box for the event should not be more than 8 hours.

**Two agendas.**

1. What is to be done in this sprint

2. Establish how it&#39;ll be done.

**What is to be done?**

1. As we know Product Owner keeps the list of backlogs, he sits with the SCRUM team and explains all the items that can be completed in this SPRINT.

1. Dev team will asses based on the Empirical data points. (How much work they were able to do in last SPRINT) - Team Velocity

_Estimation Poker - SCRUM master will arrange activities like Estimation Poker._

**How it will be done.**

1. Dev team will be able to tell the plan.
2. Not a fixed plan and evolves as more clarity increases.

**SCRUM Master work in Sprint planning.**

1. He facilitates this event.
2. Ensures everyone understands the agenda and rules for this event.
3. Is responsible for the success of all these events.

**Daily Scrum**

1. Daily 15 minutes event mainly for the dev team and SCRUM master, optional Product Owner. (Same Place and Same Time)
2. Daily SCRUM is implementation of 2 pillars (Regular inspection and Early adaptation)

**What is done**

1. Every person tells the team what he has done yesterday and what he will do today.
2. He also calls out blockers which may stop from attaining the SPRINT goal

**SPRINT review**

Review of the product increment created in the SPRINT.

Attendees : Entire SPRINT team and other Stakeholders.

Note : It&#39;s not a review or handover meeting.

Basically to increase the transparency between stakeholders and SCRUM team.

**Time Box is less than 4 Hours**

**What Happens?**

1. **Product Owner invites all attendees.**
2. Also highlights completed and non-completed items.
3. Dev team shares sprint experience, highlight challenges.
  1. Dev team demos the completed items.
  2. Stake holders ask questions on the Demo.
4. Product Owner opens the backlog and initiate discussion on what to do next.(budgets, timelines and capabilities are discussed)
5. At the end of this event product owner should have an updated backlog.

**Sprint Retrospective**

**TIMEBOX – 3 Hrs or less**

After sprint review event, we update the product backlog with the outcome of the last SPRINT this event is conducted.

Stakeholders are not invited and only SCRUM team is invited.

**Agenda**

What all went well?

1. Should be noted down and some kind of recognition has to be given

What went wrong?

1. Should be thought of as an area of improvement.

Aim of using SCRUM framework is not just to deliver the product increments but also the growth of the team and the team members.

By enhancing tools and the team members.

At the end of this meeting, we should have list of area of improvements and the plan of working on them.

**SCRUM Artifacts**

SCRUM artifacts are simply the things created during the implementation of SCRUM.

**Product backlog**

1. Is the list of all the features to be added, enhancements to be made and bugs to be fixed. (Its always evolving)
2. Changes are brought by stakeholders and business team.
3. Based on this input addition or removal to the product backlog list.
4. Product backlog refinement happens after new inputs and dev team and Product owner plans and adds them to the list
5. Check if the reqd permissions are available to deliver the requirement.

| Reqmt name | Reqmt Details | Estimated Business Value | Estimated effort | Ready?
 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ….. | ….. | …. | …. | … |

Product owner fills the above tables for all the requirements.

1. Name – By Business team
2. Details – By product owner as per the discussions from business team, dev team and other experts.
3. Estimated Business Value: Provided by Business team
4. Estimated Effort: Product owner gathers from dev team, Then arranges these in backlog in order of priority
5. Last check is to check if the product can be completed in one sprint time box, if yes then PO marks it as ready.
6. Note: Business team can only give Business value estimate and Dev team can only give effort.
7. SCRUM mater needs to ensure that the entire process of backlog refinement does not take more than 10% of the capacity of the development team.

**Sprint backlog**

1. List of items selected from the product backlog which will be completed in the current sprint constitute the sprint backlog.
2. This list of items is selected in the sprint planning event and the status of these items is discussed in the sprint review event.
3. Daily monitoring of Sprint backlog is done in the daily scrum.
4. The development team needs to regularly update the sprint backlog as per the evolved plan from the updates of the daily scrum.
5. Note: Sprint backlog is owned by the development team and all the progress can be viewed by the SCRUM team.
6. As long as the goal is not changed, dev team can freely update the SPRINT backlog.
7. But if anything can hinder achieving our goal, that needs to be intimated to the product owner and stake holders immediately.
8. It is highly visible, Stakeholders and SCRUM team.

**Increment**

**Should have the following attributes**

1. Should be usable. (Ready for production)
2. It should be inspectable. (Complete solution that is tested and verified)
3. It should include increments of the previous sprint.
4. **Definition of Done: No single definition but should be like everyone agrees to the definition. As the org evolves, we can put stricter rules.**

**Advantages and Disadvantages of SCRUM**

**Advantage:**

1. More transparency and project visibility
2. Increased team accountability
3. Easy to accommodate changes. (With short sprints and constant feedbacks)
4. Lower expenses with increased quality
5. Faster delivery
6. Customers are heard.

**Disadvantage:**

Requires high level of experience and commitments from the team

1. Risk of scope creep (Due to continuous change in the project scope due to the lack of specific end date tempting stakeholders to keep on requesting additional functionalities)
2. Daily meetings sometime frustrate team members.
3. Wrong scrum master can ruin everything.
4. Poorly defined tasks can lead to inaccuracies.
